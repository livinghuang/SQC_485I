/*
This example demonstrates how to toggle the LED on the SQC_485I board.

It initializes the board and toggles the LED state every second.
The LED is controlled through the Vext pin (GPIO2), using the `SQC_485I` library to simplify access.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The `SQC_485I` library depends on the **Heltec LoRaWAN Library** provided by Heltec.
Please make sure you have installed the Heltec LoRaWAN Library before running this example.

You can find the library here:
